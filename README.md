# DJS09: Couch Surfing | Typescript Practice

i followed through the scrimba videos rather than doing it in my own codebase because thats how i started out doing it in codespace and i don't intend to stop because it's quite handy, i tried getting it to work on vscode for 2 days on my side but i just couldn't, I am not too worried about that though because the objective was to LEARN AND PRACTICE TYPESCRIPT, which i think I've gotten a decent grasp on. It's just the installing of typescript properly and having your website then run which has given not just me but other students a problem, as well as the images not showing up??
